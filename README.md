# Demo Java Web App

Simple java project demos how to build a war file to be deployed on a Tomcat server.

## Source Url Mapping

The app is a small demo of a java servlet app.  Here's the source code to url mapping:

Source | Url
--- | ---
src/main/java/Hello.java | localhost:8080/demo/Hello
src/main/webapp/index.jsp | localhost:8080/demo/index.jsp
